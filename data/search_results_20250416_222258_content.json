It is located on the outskirts of the city. It is a landmark of Rishikesh. A larger bridge 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) downstream from Lakshman Jhula is Ram Jhula.",

This was washed away by the great flood of October, 1924 which undermined the left abutment. The extra cost of rebuilding this new bridge as nearly as possible on the site of the old bridge has been contributed by Rai Bahadur Shewpershad Tulshan to perpetuate the honored memory of his father and no toll or tax will ever be imposed or realized for crossing this bridge.",

Located in the town Rishikesh in the Indian state of Uttarakhand, the entire bridge is made up of iron, is 450 feet long and is situated at the height of 70 feet from the river.

However, it is still used by pedestrians but bikes are strictly not allowed.",

Grand temples and famous markets have sprung up in the vicinity, and the entire area is now a particularly renowned attraction in entire Rishikesh. \nImportant places around the Lakshman Jhula include the Terah Manzil temple, the Lakshman temple, and the Ram Jhula and the entire area resonates with the sounds of the enchanting mantras and shlokas from the temple.",

            "Lakshman Jhula is a popular suspension bridge in Rishikesh, India. It is one of the most famous landmarks in the city and attracts thousands of visitors every year. This iconic bridge is a symbol of the city's spiritual and cultural heritage and has a fascinating history that makes it an important part of the Indian cultural heritage. The bridge spans the Ganges River and connects the two banks of the river. It is named after Lord Laxman, the younger brother of Lord Rama from the Hindu epic, Ramayana. According to legend, Lakshman crossed the river on a jute rope at this very spot, and the bridge was constructed in his honor. The construction of the bridge is credited to the late 19th century, and it is believed to have been built by the British. The original bridge was made of jute ropes and was used for crossing the river by foot. The bridge was later rebuilt in 1929 using stronger iron cables, and it was widened to allow for the passage of vehicles and bikes. The Lakshman Jhula bridge is 450 feet long and 70 feet high from the river's surface. It offers a breathtaking view of the Ganges River and the surrounding hills. The bridge is a popular destination for tourists and pilgrims, and it provides an excellent vantage point to view the holy Ganges River and the city of Rishikesh. The Lakshman Jhula bridge is also an important part of the Hindu pilgrimage circuit. Devotees from all over the country come to Rishikesh to take a dip in the holy waters of the Ganges River and visit the various temples in the city. Lakshman Jhula is often the starting point of this spiritual journey and is visited by pilgrims from all over India and abroad. Apart from its religious and spiritual significance, Lakshman Jhula is also known for its scenic beauty. The bridge is surrounded by lush green hills and provides an excellent view of the surrounding landscape. The bridge is also a popular spot for adventure sports such as bungee jumping, zip-lining, and river rafting.\nIn recent years, there have been concerns about the bridge's safety, and the local government has considered building a new bridge to replace Lakshman Jhula. However, the bridge still stands tall and remains an important part of Rishikesh's heritage and culture. In conclusion, Lakshman Jhula is a significant landmark in Rishikesh and an important part of India's cultural heritage. The bridge's spiritual and religious significance, coupled with its scenic beauty, make it a must-visit destination for tourists and pilgrims alike. While there may be concerns about its safety, Lakshman Jhula still stands strong and serves as a testament to the city's rich history and culture.",
